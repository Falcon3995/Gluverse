# PODPal

# 🌟 PodPal – Your Intelligent Diabetes Companion

**PodPal** is a next-generation, AI-powered health assistant designed for people with **Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)**.  
It bridges your **CGM**, **pump data**, and **daily meals** to deliver **personalized insulin, food, and lifestyle insights** — all with empathy and intelligence.  

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🍽️ Food Photo Analysis
- AI-powered image recognition identifies ingredients, portion sizes, and cooking methods for precise **macronutrient estimates**.  
- Integrates **USDA/Nutritionix APIs** for carbs, fats, proteins, and fiber.  
- Flags **high-GI foods** and hidden sugars for insulin adjustment guidance.  
- Predicts **glycemic load** and **absorption delays** (e.g., fat-driven 2hr BG peak).  
- Supports **manual macro tweaks** for full control.

---

### 📈 Universal CGM Integration
- Real-time sync with **Dexcom**, **Libre**, **Medtronic**, and **Eversense** via BLE/cloud APIs.  
- Displays glucose readings, **trend arrows**, and **1–4hr histories**.  
- Syncs with **Apple Health** and wearables (activity, sleep, HRV).  
- Modular SDK for future CGMs and **manual BG entry fallback** if offline.

---

### ⚙️ Manual Pump Settings
- Input and simulate basal rates, ISF, and carb ratios.  
  Example: `Basal: 0.8U/hr`, `ISF: 1U per 50mg/dL`, `ICR: 1U per 10g carbs`.  
- Supports **Omnipod, Medtronic, Tandem, iLet**, and smart pens.  
- Tracks **IOB** and **bolus behavior** without direct pump control.  
- Extend bolus? Get **reminders every 30 minutes** automatically.

---

### 📊 BG Trend Analysis
- Visualizes **post-meal BG curves** vs target (80–140 mg/dL).  
- Attributes spikes/crashes to **macros or IOB**.  
- **ML-driven “what-if”** simulations for basal/bolus adjustments.  
- Predicts **hypo/hyper risks** using time-series forecasting.

---

### 💡 Personalized Recommendations
- Suggests bolus tweaks, basal suggestions, and **food/lifestyle swaps**.  
- Dynamic and adaptive — learns from carbs, fats, activity, and sleep data.  

---

### 🍛 Repeat-Meal Memory
- Stores each meal’s **fingerprint and BG response history**.  
- Auto-suggests optimal bolus for similar future meals.  
- Adapts with **season, time of day, or stress level**.

---

### 🧠 Friend-Like Interaction
- Empathetic **chatbot and voice mode** for motivation and alerts.  
- Gamification via **badges, streaks**, and community sharing.  

---

### 🔮 Advanced Predictive Tools
- **Weekly A1C forecasts**, disruption-aware predictions, and emotional eating detection.  
- Long-term risk modeling for proactive health management.  

---

### 🛡️ Safety & Escalation
- **Critical BG alerts** with optional **auto-exportable logs**.  
- Built on **ethical ML**, **HIPAA-compliant**, and includes **user-confirmation safeguards**.

---

### 🌍 Lifestyle Integrations
- Links to **grocery apps**, wearables, and **AR meal previews**.  
- **Community-driven recipes** and user-voted meal plans.  

---

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
- Edge computing for **local BG processing**.  
- **AES-256 encryption**, **GDPR/HIPAA compliance**, and transparent data usage policies.

---

### 💸 Scalability & Monetization
- **Freemium model**: Core features free, **$4.99/mo Pro Tier** for premium tools.  
- Multi-language support + partnerships with diabetes organizations.  
- Developer API for **third-party integrations**.

---

## ⚙️ Enhanced Features

### 🔁 Smart Learning Loop
- Users can “rate” recommendations (`Worked great 👍 / Spike ⚠️`).  
- Feedback loops improve the AI model for **personalized predictions**.

---

### 📶 Offline-First Architecture
- Works seamlessly **without cloud or CGM connection**.  
- **Local SQLite + delayed sync** ensures reliability during travel or outages.

---

### 🩺 Endocrinologist Dashboard (Pro)
- One-tap export of **summarized weekly patterns** for doctors.  
- Example: _“Meals with >50mg/dL post-meal rise = 42% this week.”_

---

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Family View / Caregiver Mode
- Ideal for **parents or partners** monitoring loved ones remotely.  
- **Panic-safe sharing:** if BG <60mg/dL for 15+ mins → auto-send live map link (opt-in).

---

### 🥗 AI Nutrition Coach
- Conversational AI recommends **smarter meal swaps**.  
  Example: _“Replace 100g chutney with 50g + curd — same taste, half the spike.”_  
- Gamifies healthy habits and **celebrates steady curves**.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack (Conceptual)
- **Frontend:** React Native (offline-first, cross-platform)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis  
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch + Time-series modeling (Prophet / LSTM)  
- **Cloud:** AWS (S3, Lambda, API Gateway)  
- **Security:** OAuth2 + AES-256 + HIPAA compliance  
- **Data Storage:** Local SQLite + Cloud Sync  

---

## 🧠 Vision
> “PodPal isn’t just another diabetes tracker — it’s your daily co-pilot,  
helping you predict, prevent, and personalize every moment of care.”
